# Automated Reasoning and Formal Verification

Material for the labs of the course `Automated Reasoning and Formal Verification` from the University of Trento (a.a. 2024/2025).

## Homework solutions

Students can open a pull request (PR) with solutions to homeworks, creating a file in `./<lab>/homeworks-students-solutions/<username>_hw_<number>.smt2` (or just send me the file via email).

I will revise the exercise and merge the PR.
