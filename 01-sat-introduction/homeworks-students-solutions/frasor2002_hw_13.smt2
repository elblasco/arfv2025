; Three variables a, b and c are needed

(declare-const c Bool)

; Let us now encode the contraints

; B is guilty and C is innocent

; If A is guilty, then C is also guilty
(assert (=> a c))

; Iâ€™m innocent and one of the others, perhaps even the two, are guilty
(assert (and (not c) (or a b)))

; The solution is sat
; A solution is one with b guilty and a and c innocent
